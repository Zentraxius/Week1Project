        <h2>Magic and Mana</h2>
        <p>
          Magic functions in a strange manner, there is a finite amount of mana
          in the world, however all of it is recycled and returned to
          circulation eventually, it is not possible to erase magic, but it is
          possible to store mana in places that become lost.
        </p>
        <p>Those learning to harness magic do so by learning of the different forms of Mana. 
            <ol>
            <li>Earth - The ground which we walk on and all within it</li>
            <li>Light - Given to us by the stars, and the absence thereof</li>
            <li>Kinetic - Manipulating the energy within all things that allows movement</li>
            <li>Force - The ability to produce kinetic energy from nothing, and keep it shapeless.</li>
            <li>Water - The liquid of life that sustains all creatures</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>Magic begins with only these elements. As your ability to hold more mana grows,
           you learn to combine elements to reach higher levels of precision and form. Eventually different types or
           sources of mana become available to you, such as Telekinesis, which uses your own mental energy, or life force, as fuel.</p>

        <h2>Natural Abilities</h2>
        <p>Ability is defined as a semi-magical or physically impossible capability 
           that is not done through use of mana. Another name for it is simply Natural Magic. 
           Vampires are the most noteworthy case of this some examples of such abilities in modern age would be:</p>
           <ul>
             <li>The ability to <strong>rage out</strong> on members of the Ares house</li>
             <li>The ability to regenerate at superhuman rates and regrow missing limbs of most vampires</li>
             <li>The unique abilities obtained by vampires who reach unknown milestones, such as Penicilens healing</li>
             <li>The House of <span class="crossout">Dracula</span> Alucard's ability to create true Damphirs and house the spirits of the dead</li>
             <li>The mental based abilities of many members of the House of Esper, such as mind reading, emotion control, and pain numbing.</li>
             <li>The ability to fly of a dragon</li>
           </ul>
           <p>Natural magic exists in many forms, often it is simply something that cannot be explained by science, due to exerting force without the viable means to do so</p>
