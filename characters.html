        <h2 class="leader">Samantha Gray</h2>
        <p>
          Sam is a nephilem of great power, she bears the prophetic title of
          <span class="title">Echidna</span> as the one who will bring about the
          return of monsters and magic. Due to her nature she is considered one
          of the most influential figures in the world by those aware of her
          existence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sam is capable of most known magic, and possesses the ability to use
          magic and science together to make otherwise impossible spells and
          devices. Due to her title, she is immune to mental assault, but lacks
          offensive power in the same department. She is known in particular for
          being able to heal even age from people, and to transmute entire
          junkyards into neat blocks of different elements. She bears the Sin of
          <span class="sin">Pride</span>.

        <h2>Archmage Arram</h2>
        <p>
          When Sam began to awaken as <span class="title">Echidna</span>, one of
          the very first people she summoned was Arram, an archmage from the
          previous Era who had been trapped in time due to a miscalculated spell
        </p>
        <p>
          As per his rank, Arram is a mage of incredible power who is often
          underestimated due to his easygoing attitude. He possess invaluable
          knowledge about the previous Era and its magicks and creatures. He has
          a Cloudkeeper Dragon as a bonded Familiar, nicknamed Demi.
        </p>

        <h2>Alice Gray</h2>
        <p>
          Due to a fertility ritual gone horribly wrong, Sam was able to get
          pregnant as a Nephilem, with her vampire husband Thomas. Their only
          child, a little girl named Alice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alice is a strange case, due to her Nephilem heritage she grew and
          developed quickly until she reached the physical age of about 14 by
          the time she was years old. She possess the title of
          <span class="title">Dreamseer</span> and can not only visit other
          peoples dreams, but record them from memory and modify them at will
          regardless of distance. She bears the Sin of
          <span class="sin">Gluttony</span>
        </p>

        <img class="image2" src="img/corrin.jpg" />
        <h2>Corrin Bray</h2>
        <p>
          Corrin is a regular human who got into <em>The School</em> on full
          scholarship just like Sam. His backstory and family history isn't a
          pretty one, but he's managed to be Sam's roommate since she started at
          school. The two maintain a very close platonic relationship as Corrin
          is in a relationship with Blake, Robin's roommate and the two of them
          consider each other something akin to brother and sister
        </p>
        <p>
          Due to accidental teaching, Corrin has learned how to use Magic, and
          seems to specialize in Illusions.

        <img class="image2" src="img/robin.jpg" />
        <h2>Robin</h2>
        <p>
          One of the most ancient vampires alive, Robin was turned at the very
          end of the previous Era, making her several
          <strong>billion</strong> years old. However, by her reports, she spent
          the majority of that time in a stasis like coma or sleep, and has less
          than 50,000 years of actual waking time to her name. She is almost
          always found reading or trying to do so.
        </p>
        <p>
          Robin is the longest standing <span class="title">Fate</span>, being
          the oracle of the Present, she is the one who gave Sam the first
          prophetic reading that she was
          <span class="title">Echidna</span> although she has no memory of this.
          She can see all that goes on in the present around people she's
          remotely close to or linked with. She can read the minds and transfer
          memories of sleeping people. In addition, she possesses great wisdom,
          and acts as an advisor and voice of reason to those who know her, even
          her "sister" Fubuki, values her input, despite their age gap. She has
          read, reportedly, every book she's ever seen, and fondly remembers the
          Library of Alexandria. Due to her reading, she possesses a great
          understanding of magic despite not using it.

      <div class="col-md-3">
        <img class="image2" src="img/fubuki.webp" />
        <h2 class="leader">Fubuki</h2>
        <p>
          Fubuki is the oldest active character in history, being a just a
          thousand years older than Robin, who she considers her sister, but
          unlike Robin, she has been awake for basically the entire time,
          barring one Ice Age. She leads the House of Esper and the vampires
          within it and also acts as the world leader of Italy. She has lived in
          Italy for several centuries and slowly built up an esteemed reputation
          with the Vatican Church, particularly with the new Pope, who is more
          empathetic towards Vampires.
        </p>
        <p>
          An original Nephilem turned Vampire and then returned to Nephilem,
          Fubuki possesses indescribable depths of knowledge regarding magic,
          history, and culture. She possesses frighteningly powerful
          Telekinesis, able to manipulate kinetic energy at a level of precision
          out of reach for most actual mages, and she kept this power even as a
          vampire. She can leech kinetic energy from objects to cool them down,
          but does so at a rate that shatters most material. She can reverse
          this to heat the world around her. She rarely uses her ability for
          things other than typical telekinesis.

      <div class="col-md-3">
        <img class="image2" src="img/ares.jpg" />
        <h2 class="leader">Ares the God of War</h2>
        <p>
          Despite the terrifying power Fubiki has, to freeze lakes, trigger
          volcanoes, and reportedly shatter a continent, when people
          <em>in the know</em> speak of true overwhelming power. They all think
          of Ares, as the founder of the
          <span class="ares">House of Ares</span> he is where their powers
          descend from. Reportedly, he is retired out of sheer boredom due to
          being unable to enjoy fighting in the modern era of ranged combat.
        </p>
        <p>
          The powers that his house possess are all watered down versions of his
          power. Which is a form of Kinetic manipulation pushed to an extreme
          that borders on reality-warping. When some of the greatest members of
          his house tap into their <em>Ares Rage</em> they lose control of
          themselves, crackle with energy, and emit tangible heatwaves,
          sometimes even melting or burning nearby objects. Ares sears the life
          out of countries and simply absorbs energy thrown towards him. Making
          him effectively unbeatable without the use of magic, and virtually so
          even with it. Lately he has become an avid gamer due to the
          possibility of a challenge amongst pro circuits.

        <h2 class="title">Lucifer Morningstar</h2>
        <p>
          An ancient Nephilem from Fubuki's time, known throughout history as
          Lucifer the Fallen Angel. Currently acting as the mysterious
          <span class="title">headmaster</span> in charge of
          <em>The School</em> and playing a powerful role in the UN.
        </p>
        <p>
          The headmasters powers are vastly unknown, preferring to perform
          actions from the sidelines and to observe as things unfold. His
          opinions on histories view of him as the devil are unknow, however
          Fubuki claims he's one of the better people, and as such, gives him
          the benefit of the doubt.

        <h2>Maria Espinoza</h2>
        <p>
          Maria is a regular human, albeit a shockingly healthy, in shape, and
          genetically clean due to various healings from Sam. This is in stark
          contrast to the rest of her family who, until very recently, have
          lived in some of the worst states of poverty in the U.S.
        </p>
        <p>
          Maria possesses no magical abilities and quite possibly no magical
          talent. She is however a fantastic cook and chef, and frequently makes
          food for everyone at Sam's house. She teaches Alice about cooking and
          frequently made projects with her as they grew up, including making a
          dragon out of fruit. Which Arram then enchanted to fly around.

        <h2>Zachariah Gray</h2>
        <p>
          Sam's older brother Zach spent the majority of his life involved with
          drug running and vampire hunting, the former used to fund the latter
          he would have continued on this path had he not ended up in a
          relationship with the vampire, Penicilen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Zach and Sam's parents were brutally killed by vampires when they were
          young children, while Sam went away to various foster homes, Zach
          ended up in seedier areas. Due to a mixture of luck and skill Zach has
          been a successful Vampire-Hunter for many years and has his own group
          of hunters with him. Since evolving back into a Nephilem from his
          family crypt, he has all the physical attributes of a Nephilem
          including powerful wings.

        <h2>Penicilen</h2>
        <p>
          Penicilen, or Pen, is roughly 15,000 years old as a vampire, and
          possesses the unique ability of healing and preventing poisons and
          diseases, thus the nickname Penicilen. She claims to have been born in
          what is roughly the icelandic region and is one of the more benevolent
          and kind vampires.
