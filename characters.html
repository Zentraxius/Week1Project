        <h2>Samantha Gray</h2>
        <p>
          Sam is a nephilem of great power, she bears the prophetic title of
          <span class="title">Echidna</span> as the one who will bring about the
          return of monsters and magic. Due to her nature she is considered one
          of the most influential figures in the world by those aware of her
          existence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sam is capable of most known magic, and possesses the ability to use
          magic and science together to make otherwise impossible spells and
          devices. Due to her title, she is immune to mental assault. She bears

        <h2>Archmage Arram</h2>
        <p>
          When Sam began to awaken as <span class="title">Echidna</span>, one of
          the very first people she summoned was Arram, an archmage from the
          previous Era who had been trapped in time due to a miscalculated spell
        </p>
        <p>
          As per his rank, Arram is a mage of incredible power who is often
          underestimated due to his easygoing attitude. He possess invaluable
          knowledge about the previous Era and its magicks and creatures. He has
          a Cloudkeeper Dragon as a bonded Familiar, nicknamed Demi.

        <h2>Alice Gray</h2>
        <p>
          Due to a fertility ritual gone horribly wrong, Sam was able to get
          pregnant as a Nephilem, with her vampire husband Thomas. Their only
          child, a little girl named Alice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alice is a strange case, due to her Nephilem heritage she grew and
          developed quickly until she reached the physical age of about 14 by
          the time she was years old. She possess the title of
          <span class="title">Dreamseer</span> and can not only visit other
          peoples dreams, but record them from memory and modify them at will
          regardless of distance. She bears the Sin of
          <span class="sin">Gluttony</span>
