        <h2>Modern Changes</h2>
        <p>
          Many things are different from what you know. There are changes going
          on in the world that <strong>they</strong> don't want you to know
          about. To begin, we will cover what happened from the viewpoint in
          time of 2032, the year <span class="leader">Sam</span> first attended
          <em>The School</em>.

            Formerly, the vampires of the world used to do their best to hide in
            plain site, and simply blend in. Those times have past and they have
            made their move on a global scale. It started by allying themselves
            with the United Nations a few years past. It has long been known
            amongst the most average of first world citizens, that the major
            world leaders no longer cared for them, and those who did were kept
            from power by any means necessary. The
            <span class="leader">Head's of House</span> used this to their
            advantage to begin making their move. By connecting with the few
            uncorrupt world leaders and installing their own slowly where
            necessary, they began to align themselves with powerful allies on a
            global scale within the rooms of the UN. Rarely if ever meeting in
            person, their communications done in private, quickly becoming a
            seperate faction while still flying under the UN flag.
          </p>
          <p>
            Armed with the power of close to 10% of the global economy, and
            formed by the guidance of the
            <span class="leader">Headmaster</span>, this split faction of the UN
            began to take action, and moved with an overwhelming confidence the
            UN had always meant to have. By simply bypassing the entirety of the
            political red tape and chest puffing the UN had become known for,
            and armed with more money and connections than any one man could
            dream of, they quickly established a UN Embassy in northern New York
            under the guise of making a global university for the worlds
            brightest and most talented. The entrance requirements quickly
            became headline news around the world for one simple fact. The
            school publicly welcomed vampire students and had roughly a third of
            its student body as such. While the embassy was founded in 2016, it
            had not become a school and operational until 2024.
          </p>

          <p>
            Though the details of their relationship remains a mystery, the new
            Governor of New York who had taken office in 2022 was very welcoming
            and supportive of the school and its efforts and held the school in
            great confidence. It was because of this support that the many
            riots, attempted vandalism, and outrage, were quelled at the behest
            of the National Guard. Vampires had been, until now, fairly disliked
            worldwide, with the loose exception of Italy. Now, suddenly public,
            and tucked away safe within the confines of a UN Embassy,
            figureheads around the world were baffled, as was the main faction
            of the UN, especially when they discovered they no longer had a
            voice with this new faction that operated under their name.
