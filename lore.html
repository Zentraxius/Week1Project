        <p>
          Many things are different from what you know. There are changes going
          on in the world that <strong>they</strong> don't want you to know
          about. To begin, we will cover what happened from the viewpoint in
          time of 2032, the year <span class="leader">Sam</span> first attended
          <em>The School</em>.

            Formerly, the vampires of the world used to do their best to hide in
            plain site, and simply blend in. Those times have past and they have
            made their move on a global scale. It started by allying themselves
            with the United Nations a few years past. It has long been known
            amongst the most average of first world citizens, that the major
            world leaders no longer cared for them, and those who did were kept
            from power by any means necessary. The
            <span class="leader">Head's of House</span> used this to their
            advantage to begin making their move. By connecting with the few
            uncorrupt world leaders and installing their own slowly where
            necessary, they began to align themselves with powerful allies on a
            global scale within the rooms of the UN. Rarely if ever meeting in
            person, their communications done in private, quickly becoming a
            seperate faction while still flying under the UN flag.
          </p>
          <p>
            Armed with the power of close to 10% of the global economy, and
            formed by the guidance of the
            <span class="leader">Headmaster</span>, this split faction of the UN
            began to take action, and moved with an overwhelming confidence the
            UN had always meant to have. By simply bypassing the entirety of the
            political red tape and chest puffing the UN had become known for,
            and armed with more money and connections than any one man could
            dream of, they quickly established a UN Embassy in northern New York
            under the guise of making a global university for the worlds
            brightest and most talented. The entrance requirements quickly
            became headline news around the world for one simple fact. The
            school publicly welcomed vampire students and had roughly a third of
            its student body as such. While the embassy was founded in 2016, it
            had not become a school and operational until 2024.
          </p>

          <p>
            Though the details of their relationship remains a mystery, the new
            Governor of New York who had taken office in 2022 was very welcoming
            and supportive of the school and its efforts and held the school in
            great confidence. It was because of this support that the many
            riots, attempted vandalism, and outrage, were quelled at the behest
            of the National Guard. Vampires had been, until now, fairly disliked
            worldwide, with the loose exception of Italy. Now, suddenly public,
            and tucked away safe within the confines of a UN Embassy,
            figureheads around the world were baffled, as was the main faction
            of the UN, especially when they discovered they no longer had a
            voice with this new faction that operated under their name.
          </p>
          <p>
            This led to a worldwide cold war from the years of 2024 to 2031. The
            original UN was outraged by these "imposters" however the impressive
            power the new faction held kept anyone from making a direct move
            against them, after all, that wouldn't be politically correct.
            Having done great work to establish allies behind the scenes, such
            as eliminating the leadership of North Korea in exchange for Korea
            as an ally, various bribes and hands of assistance had earned the
            split faction of the UN enough allies and political presence across
            the world to not only claim the flag of the UN as their own, but to
            also undermine the remainder of the UN to the point people
            considered <em>them</em> to be the imposter. Through military
            contracts with various nations, the elite vampires of the
            <span class="ares">House of Ares</span>, and mercenaries from around
            the world, the new faction of the UN usurped the previous leaders in
            its entirety and brought the presence of the UN to its rightful
            place.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the now considerable respect and fear of the UN behind it, the
            school continued to teach classes while acting as the headquarters
            of the new world power. Bringing teachers in from around the world,
            nobel prize winning scientists and authors, vampires older than
            recorded history, and vampire hunters of legend, all gathered at the
            school to teach subjects at the highest level possible. Only the
            most wealthy could even try to buy their way into the school,
            tuition ran well over 8 figures in the U.S, due to the tuition
            including on site living, cutting edge medical care, security,
            living spaces, food, education, and more. Less than 1% of the
            students at any given time were there under their own finances. The
            rest were all under full coverage scholarships competitive enough to
            kill over.
          </p>
          <p>
            The school searched for many qualities in its students, as such, its
            scholarships were difficult to apply for, and often would simply
            arrive at your door. </p>
