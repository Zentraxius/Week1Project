        The Nephilim, (Nephilem) have been forgotten to history by all but the
        most ancient of records and memories. As the cycle of life, and magic,
        comes full circle with the herald of the new era, the original
        descendants of creation return to the world, led by the new
        <span class="title">Echidna</span>. The forgotten beings of magic make
        their return, at the same time the <em>Four Houses</em> join with the
        <em>United Nations</em> to bring the world together, by force if needed.
