    <h1>The Nephilem's Return</h1>

    <div class="openparagraph">
      <h>
        The Nephilim, (Nephilem) have been forgotten to history by all but the
        most ancient of records and memories. As the cycle of life, and magic,
        comes full circle with the herald of the new era, the original
        descendants of creation return to the world, led by the new
        <span class="title">Echidna</span>. The forgotten beings of magic make
        their return, at the same time the <em>Four Houses</em> join with the
        <em>United Nations</em> to bring the world together, by force if needed.

        There are many facets of information to go over, the figureheads in the
        new world order, the lore and background that has led up to this point,
        and just what <em>is</em> magic anyways? I hope to cover all of this,
        and more, in the following documentation.
